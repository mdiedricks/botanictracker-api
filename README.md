## General Information
This is a amulti-stage personal project to build a platform to track the care and environments of my plants.

The first stage is to build out basic CRUD functionality for tracking plant-care manually, with later stages involving embedded devices to track certain data automatically.

## Technology Used
[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Project Status
This project is in it's early stages as I build out the day-to-day functionality.

#### Work to follow
* Flesh-out a mobile friendly frontend - the webapp will need to be used on mobile
* Develop embedded device for manually reading soil moisture and sending it to the DB for a specific plant
* Develop embedded devices to collect daily environmental data, and periodically send it to DB
